#Camp Timer

This is a single page website that I built so that a mate could play certain sounds through his computer at the times that set.

It's built using straight HTML, CSS and jQuery.

You can find a working version at [Camp Timer](http://playground.bretteast.me/camp_timer)


#HTML5 Boilerplate

This file was built on the back of the HTML5 Boilerplate

HTML5 Boilerplate is a professional front-end template for building fast,
robust, and adaptable web apps or sites.

This project is the product of many years of iterative development and combined
community knowledge. It does not impose a specific development philosophy or
framework, so you're free to architect your code in the way that you want.
